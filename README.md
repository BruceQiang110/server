# WTF?!

If you ask a experienced developer what he's thinking about content management systems, he'll probably tell you that he doesn't like them since they're bloated, overkill and slow as fuck. Muffin would like to change that.

Of course it doesn't yet have those cool features which all the other cool kids on the block are showing off. But it's very ambitious and always has an open ear for feedback from all angles!
