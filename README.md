# muffin

If you ask a experienced developer what he's thinking about content management systems, he'll probably tell you that he doesn't like them since they're bloated, overkill and slow as fuck. Muffin would like to change that.

Of course it doesn't yet have those cool features which all the other cool kids on the block are showing off, but it's very ambitious and always has an open ear for feedback from all angles!

## Use me

If you'd like to use muffin for your next project, simply install our neat [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator and set up a new boilerplate within the current directory.

```bash
npm install -g generator-muffin
yo muffin
```

## Contribute

Muffin currently consits of two parts. To determine which of those two is the right place for your changes, you should ask yourself the following: Is it related to the admin area? Then read on after this paragraph. And if it's related to the output that is being generated by muffin, please rather take a look at [this](https://github.com/leo/generator-muffin).

Clone this repo

```shell
git clone git://github.com/leo/muffin.git
cd muffin
```

Install gulp (muffin's build tool) and all other dependencies

```shell
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

You made it! Now you only need to start the app and it will be running here: [http://localhost:2000/muffin](http://localhost:2000/muffin).

```shell
npm start
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests, install [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and run it:

```shell
npm install -g mocha
mocha
```
