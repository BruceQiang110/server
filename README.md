# What? Another CMS?

If you ask a experienced developer what he's thinking about content management systems, he'll probably tell you that he doesn't like them since they're bloated, overkill and slow as fuck. Muffin would like to change that.

Of course it doesn't yet have those cool features which all the other cool kids on the block are showing off. But it's very ambitious and always has an open ear for feedback from all angles!

## Use me

If you'd like to use muffin for your next project, simply install our neat command line interface and generate a new boilerplate within the current directory.

```bash
npm install -g muffin-cli
muffin init
```

## Develop me

Clone this repo

```shell
git clone git://github.com/leo/muffin.git
cd muffin
```

Install gulp, muffin's build tool

```shell
npm install -g gulp
```

Install all other dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Start developing

You've made it! Now you only need to start the app and it will be running here: [http://localhost:2000/muffin](http://localhost:2000/muffin).

```shell
npm start
```
