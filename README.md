# muffin

If you ask a experienced developer what he's thinking about content management systems, he'll probably tell you that he doesn't like them since they're bloated, overkill and slow as fuck. Muffin would like to change that.

Of course it doesn't yet have those cool features which all the other cool kids on the block are showing off, but it's very ambitious and always has an open ear for feedback from all angles!

## Requirements

To be able to use muffin, you'll need **the latest version** of those things. So please make sure they're updated before trying out this application.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)

## Use me

If you'd like to use muffin for your next project, simply install our neat [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator and set up a new boilerplate within the current directory.

```bash
npm install -g generator-muffin
yo muffin
```
